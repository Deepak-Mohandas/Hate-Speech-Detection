# Hate Speech Detection

The term hate speech is understood as any type of verbal, written or behavioural communication that attacks or uses derogatory or discriminatory language against a person or group based on what they are, in other words, based on their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, ancestry, sex or another identity factor.

Hate Speech Detection is generally a task of sentiment classification. So for training, a model that can classify hate speech from a certain piece of text can be achieved by training it on a data that is generally used to classify sentiments.
